This file includes non-tivial sql queries that are used against the car_dealer database.
Variables remain in there php-form.
================================================================================

1) Search cars by VIN, and retrieve names of make and model:
	"SELECT VIN, name as make_name, model_name, year, drive_train_id,  trans_serial_number, engine_id, engine_serial_number 
	FROM make NATURAL JOIN (
		SELECT VIN, make_id as id, name AS model_name, year, drive_train_id,  trans_serial_number, engine_id, engine_serial_number 
		FROM model NATURAL JOIN (
			SELECT VIN, model_id as id, year, drive_train_id,  trans_serial_number, engine_id, engine_serial_number FROM car WHERE vin = '" . $vin . "') 
		AS model_car) 
	AS model_make_car"

2) Search drive-trains by transmission code:
	"SELECT * FROM drive_train WHERE trans_code = '" . $transCode . "'"

3) Search engines by engine code:
	"SELECT * FROM engine WHERE engine_code = '" . $engineCode . "'"
	
4) Search models of particular make:
	"SELECT * FROM model WHERE make_id = " . $make_choice
	
5) Search cars for given make and model:
	"SELECT vin, year, drive_train_id,  trans_serial_number, engine_id, engine_serial_number 
	FROM car 
	WHERE model_id = " . $model_choice"

6) Search for name of a particular model:
	"SELECT name FROM model WHERE id = " . $model_choice	
	
7) Search for name of the make of a particular model:
	"SELECT name 
	FROM make 
	WHERE id IN (
		SELECT make_id AS id 
		FROM model 
		WHERE id = " . $model_choice . ")"
		
8) Search for specific cars within a given miles per gallan (mpg) range, then finds names of make and model:  (mpg ranges are: "mpg < 20", "mpg BETWEEN 20 AND 30", "mpg >= 30") 	
	"SELECT mpg, name as make_name, model_name, year, vin 
	FROM make NATURAL JOIN (
		SELECT vin, make_id as id, name as model_name, year, mpg 
		FROM model NATURAL JOIN (
			SELECT vin, model_id as id, year, mpg 
			FROM car NATURAL JOIN performance_spec 
			WHERE " . $mpg_range . ") 
		AS car_model_mpg)
	AS car_model_make_mpg"
	
9) Using a particular VIN, searches for a car's performance specifications, make, and model:
	"SELECT name as make_name, model_name, year, drive_train_id, engine_id, accel_to_sixty_mph, mpg, breaking_distance 
	FROM make NATURAL JOIN (
		SELECT make_id as id, name as model_name, year, engine_id, drive_train_id, accel_to_sixty_mph, mpg, breaking_distance 
		FROM model NATURAL JOIN (
			SELECT * 
			FROM performance_spec NATURAL JOIN (
				SELECT * 
				FROM car 
				WHERE vin = '" . $vin . "') 
			AS car_spec) 
		AS car_spec_model 
		WHERE model_id = id) 
	AS car_spec_model_make"
